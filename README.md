## <a name="about"></a> ðŸŒ´ About the Developer:
Lynda graduated from UC Davis with a BS in Human Development and started working in Early Childhood programs after graduation. After learning more about 
the exciting world of tech, she broke her way in and spent the next 8 years in various Recruiting positions. where she helped build and scale 
teams at tiny startups, pre-IPO and large tech companies.  Although this work was challenging in its own way, Lynda missed learning and wanted to develop 
her problem solving skills through programming. She was also inspired by many other women in the industry who made a career change and hopes that she can 
continue working toward increasing women's representation in technical roles.
